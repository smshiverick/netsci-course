    "Now if we were to open the graph in Gephi we should be able to use the link communities to color the graph edges. In Gephi you may need to click the little attribute type button so that edge attributes are set to [ranked rather than numeric](http://www.clementlevallois.net/gephi/tuto/en/gephi_cheat%20sheets_en.pdf). This is because we want to color the edges according to their membership and not with a gradient. Additionally, in order to keep the edge colors when saving the graph you will need to make sure the edge color in the Preview tab is set to `original`. Lastly, since you will be looking at link communities (which determine the node membership in link clustering) it will be helpful to increase the size of the edges in Gephi so the colors are more visible and so you can detect nodes that belong to multiple communities.\n",

The nodes of the graph are people and links are formed between people who co-author a scientific paper together in network science. You can download it from [here](http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/collab/netscience.htm). Make sure to read the graph description on that page. The graph has ~1500 nodes and is partly disconnected. If you have difficulty working with the full graph or trouble loading it into Gephi, you can use the largest connected component (which only has about 350 nodes). The largest connected component of a graph can be returned from networkx using:\n",
